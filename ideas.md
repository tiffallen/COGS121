<h1> IDEA ONE: Dogs in your area </h1>
    <p>
    Users would input their dog's location information in order to see the other dogs in their area. The functionality would use maps such that the user can click on a certain city/area and see how many dogs are there as well as see statistics about the dogs in that area (%breed, etc)
    </p>
<h1> IDEA TWO: Dog walkers </h1>
    <p>
    Users would log their dog's walks/runs so their friends can see where they are walking their dogs (in addition to inviting people  to walk with them). The functionality would use maps such that the user would be able to save past walking routes and users can see the most popular "walks" in the area.
    </p>
<h1> IDEA THREE: Remember This </h1>
    <p>
    As you visit places that you have been before, the app will alert you and remind you of your past experiences with pictures of your experiences there.
    </p>
<h1> IDEA FOUR: Study Buddy </h1>
    <p>
    As you approach tests and such, studying becomes important but seems hard to form study groups. This app will allow users to input where they are studying (in addition to what class) in order to find other users in the area who they can study with.
    </p>
<h1> IDEA FIVE: Location based information page for UCSD </h1>
    <p>
    Ideal for users who walk around UCSD but have no idea what the different art pieces mean. Rather than having to google certain characteristics about it, the user will be able to pull up this app. The app will navigate them to a map of UCSD, and they can click on their current location. Their location will have an information page about the site they are at (art, statues, lecture halls, etc).
    </p>

<h1> EXTRA IDEAS </h1>

<h2> IDEA SIX: FB Event Mapper</h2>
	<p>
	This app allows you to pin events from your facebook you are intersted in onto a map, and see what events are going on in different areas. For example if you are going to be at UCSD tomorrow, you can see the events going on there. This is ideal for traveling, or just planning out your weekend activities. Also good for organizing events you may have forgotten about.
	</p>

<h2> IDEA SEVEN: Remember this: TODO </h2>
	<p>
	This app allows you to create location based todo lists, that remind you of tasks you need to do while at a certain location. For example, you can create a ToBuy list for your local grocery store, or a list of things you need to do at the library, or things you need to talk about with your friend at their apartment. This allows the activities you need to do, to be more dynamic, and create reminders for them when you need them the most.
	</p>

<h2> IDEA EIGHT: BS Finder </h2>
	<p>
	This app works to help you find open B and S spots on UCSD campus. This app would work based on user input, where people report when they leave their S spots, so that people know when a spot was last avaliable, and the likelyhood that it is still there.
