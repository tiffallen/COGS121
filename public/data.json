Ferrara is one of several artists who emerged during the seventies by using the forms and materials usually associated with architecture in order to enrich the definition of sculpture and challenge the assumptions and conventions of the typical built environment. Ferrara's complexly patterned paved areas, based on a grid system, transform bland outdoor plazas or indoor lobbies into animated spaces which help to enliven or accentuate their architectural context.

For this research center Ferrara designed a series of three distinct spaces: a small south terrace enclosed on three sides; a central area dominated by the stairs leading up to the building entrance and conference tower; and a large enclosed north terrace. Each area is paved with a similar linear pattern of green, red, and black slate and surrounded by compacted gravel. Each has a unique character, but the terraces flow into one another becoming one continuous space. She has placed Australian willows and benches in lines which echo the grid of the slate and the lines of the low walls. The cloistered intimacy of the terraces, with their suggestion of early or monumental architecture, provides a space of contemplation for the scientists who work in the center, and articulates and emphasizes the architectural motifs of the building itself. Ferrara's work also draws together the two wings of the building and organizes its circulation patterns. ",
      "article3" : "Ferrara's other projects include collaborative works in Atlanta, St. Paul and Phoenix using water, granite, slate, grass and trees; and three major works in Minneapolis - a large cedar structure in the Walker Art Center's outdoor sculpture garden; a courtyard at the General Mills headquarters, in which she used local pale yellow and off-white limestone; and the 60-foot-tall red granite Stepped Tower on the University of Minnesota campus. In addition to making subtly colored sculptures constructed of wood, she also completed a lobby for a new Seattle convention center, and designed nearly an acre of patterned tile flooring for the Greater Pittsburgh Airport. Ferrara designed a red granite amphitheater for Hancock Park at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, which was completed in 1999.  She has recieved the Excellence in Design Award from the Art Commission for the City of New York and the Institute Honor from the A.I.A. for making a significant contribution to the environment and profession of architecture.

For the literary tree, Bale Allen delivers his poem about scabs, the poet Philip Levine recites, plus there are Navajo chants, translations of Aztec poems, duck calls, and many other sound works.

Since completing Trees, Allen has done many public works across the country, including CORPORATE HEAD and the Citicorp Building in Los Angeles and large bronze leaf (BELIEF) for The Vontz Cancer research center designed by Frank Gehry in Cincinnati. He has also released eleven CDs (Sugar Hill Records) and written and produced seven theater pieces including Chippy for the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia and the Lincoln Center in New York City. In 1997, he was inducted into the Buddy Holly \"Walk of Fame\" in Lubbock, Texas.

Instead of its usual context as interior office furniture, the fountain is placed monument like on a grass island in the center of Myers Drive next to the university administration offices and the Price Center.

The fountain, in its modesty and its reversal of the traditional grandeur of water fountains as public monuments, also calls to mind Southern California's need to manage and preserve its natural resources in light of the ongoing water crisis caused by large-scale agricultural and urban development.

The most prominent doors at UCSD were at the entrance to the Geisel Library, a landmark building designed by the California architect William Pereira, with a 1992 expansion by Gunnar Birkerts. Baldessari decided first to transform the library doors and then to incorporate the entire lobby space, choosing students as his subject. The entrance to the Geisel Library is comprised of a wall of eight ten-foot high glass panels flanking two pairs of automatic sliding doors.

Upending paradigms of the classical figure and hierarchies of artistic materials with her use of glass, beads, paper and wax, Smith created poignant and sometimes disturbing images.",
      "article2" : "Her focus on the body and its functions defied traditional distinctions between public and private subject matter. Smith's vision of the body as a fluid vehicle for intimating life - and death - suggested the School of Medicine as fertile territory for Standing, her Stuart Collection project. From the beginning her ideas evolved in relation to the site between the Medical Teaching Facility and the Basic Sciences Building amidst eucalyptus trees, sloping lawns and curving pathways. There is a sense of quiet intimacy that is activated by the flow of foot traffic between classes. Smith's original idea of a figure on a classical column soon evolved to become a figure on a cast tree trunk. A dead tree was located on campus, removed and delicately cast at San Diego Pre-Cast Concrete. So refined is the casting that it has captured the network of beetle trails that once lay under the thin eucalyptus bark -- a feature that originally drew Smith's interest. The paths of these insects, which may have played a role in the tree's death, evoke notions of veins and capillaries; the trunk's artery-like roots reach into the water below. Stripped of its bark and exposed through time and decay, it is remarkable in the way that it calls out the live eucalyptus around the site, thus embracing - even composing - the entire area. Pathways were reconfigured and added by the artist to extend the arterial imagery. Cast from a live model, Standing calls forth thoughts of human strength and frailty, and both the power and the limits of medicine. Serene and ageless, the figure atop the trunk is poised in a Madonna-like pose that is both vulnerable and generous. Ribbons of water - the source of life - flow from her hands in to the rock-lined pond below, introducing soothing, mellifluous sound. The skin surface of the body itself is violated to reveal the musculature and tendons of arms and calves, reflecting Smith's interest in such anatomical illustrations and models as Gray's Anatomy. A \"necklace\" of starfish-headed pins, placed in the shape of the constellation Virgo, pierces the flesh, calling up a profusion of associations, from acupuncture to dissection to martyrdom. With these tiny starfish like a veil of Virgo gems, the delicate pins call up at once the oceanic and the celestial, in an image that speaks of mind and body, of flesh and healing. Standing",

They remind us that we can’t bury that history, and that we have to continually confront it as a community.” The May 1970 Peace Memorial is located adjacent to the Revelle Plaza Fountain and features a marble plaque complete with a light installation. A bench was added to the space, as was a newly planted coral tree, to give students a place to remember and commemorate the protests for peace since May 1970. According to Twohig, the May 1970 Peace Memorial was made possible through the collaborative efforts of students, staff, faculty, former campus activists, Winne’s surviving family, and campus leadership. Students worked closely with staff in Resource Management and Planning on the design of the memorial and selection of its location. “The memorial is a wonderful opportunity to infuse UC San Diego’s past activism into the fabric of our future,” said Gary Matthews, vice chancellor of Resource Management and Planning.",
      "article4" : "Jorge Mariscal, a professor in the literature department and director of the DOC program, has been a strong supporter of the creation of the memorial. \"The May 1970 Peace Memorial opens a window to a past moment when hundreds of UC San Diego students rallied in Revelle Plaza to protest what they considered to be an immoral war,” said Mariscal. “At the same time, it alerts us to the fact that young people around the world continue to struggle for peace and justice.\" An inscription on the memorial reads “For George Winne, Jr., the student activists of May 1970, and all those who continue the struggle for a peaceful world.” Gracy Uriarte is an undergraduate who was enrolled in Twohig’s course and has been involved in the planning of the May 1970 Peace Memorial. “The memorial helps honor Winne’s spirit and helps create and foster a dialogue of ways to persevere for a more peaceful world,\" Uriarte said.",
      "article5" : "The light installation was added to the plaque to reflect a constellation of stars, a visual concept that pays homage to history, according to Twohig. “What we find is often not what we expected because, like light from old stars, those histories shed light on the present and illuminate what a just world might look like,” he said. The memorial is part of the revitalization of Revelle College’s Plaza. Blake Hall was recently renovated and the Plaza Café’s construction is in progress. In addition, a new 417-seat lecture hall in Galbraith Hall has opened its doors, as did the refurbished new student study space (formerly CLICS library).

      "article1" : "Nam June Paik (1932-2006) was born in Korea, but moved to New York City in 1964. He is frequently referred to as \"the grandfather of video art.\" Paik began his career as a composer and musician studying at the University of Tokyo, the University of Munich, and the Conservatory of Music in Freiburg, Germany. Influenced by the composer John Cage, Paik's interests brought him into the orbit of Fluxus, an international postwar movement of artists -- many of whom were influenced by the earlier work of Duchamp and Dada -- who sought to break down the barriers between high art and everyday life. Fluxus is often considered \"anti-art\" in its sometimes violent renunciation of conventional definitions of the art object. ",
      "article2" : "Paik was first drawn to video in the context of his music; it was the random quality of the television soundtrack which initially appealed to him. For over three decades, however, he was a provocative and prophetic spokesman for new uses of television technology and for the relevance of TV to art. He used television sets in startling constructions for performances (i.e., the TV as cello, bra, or glasses) and designed installations composed of televisions transformed into aquariums, and stacked as pyramids. Paik also made TV chairs and many versions of TV robots. He combined fast-paced video clips -- often dramatically colorized -- in high-energy montages programmed over several television monitors. Paik was a pioneer in combining straight or manipulated segments of broadcast TV with artist-produced videos, organized by a complex visual and aural matrix.", 
      "article3" : "Paik's Something Pacific for the Stuart Collection was his first permanent outdoor installation. This work relates specifically to its site, which includes the lobby of the university's Media Center as well as the lawns surrounding the building. Outdoors, the work features several ruined televisions embedded in the landscape; some are paired with Buddhas, and one, a tiny Sony Watchman, is topped by a miniature reproduction of Rodin's Thinker. In striking contrast to this video graveyard, the lobby of the Media Center houses one of Paik's lively interactive banks of TV monitors. By means of a control panel, viewers are able to manipulate sequences of Paik's own tapes and broadcast MTV. Like much of Paik's art, Something Pacific's outdoor and indoor sections use the video medium to contrast two very different experiences of time -- one involving extended contemplation and the other instantaneous reaction. More importantly, the scattered ruins of televisions offer a cautionary tale for those entering the Media Center. Paik places televisions in the landscape in order to dramatize his belief that television has defined the American landscape since World War II. The outdoor TVs are all \"dead\" sets, skeletal remains that Paik has returned to nature, perhaps to be discovered in future archeological digs.",

Smith combines fragments from the mass media like magazine covers or dust jackets of the 1940s with a wide range of kitsch and found objects. Often she has organized several collages into sequences, implying a coherent narrative. As in a film, related fragments of text (almost a \"soundtrack\") link one collage to another. Smith has also painted large motifs directly onto a gallery's walls and then hung her smaller framed works on this mural-like background. In this way she succeeds in transforming the art space itself into a collage. In recent years Smith has expanded this impulse to work environmentally, doing many large-scale permanent installations including terrazzo floors for the Los Angeles Convention Center and the Schottenstein Sports Arena at Ohio State University in Columbus.",

The tail wraps around an existing concrete pathway as a snake would wrap itself around a tree limb. Along the way, the serpent's slightly crowned body circles around a small \"garden of Eden\" with several fruit trees including a pomegranate. There is a marble bench with a quote from Thomas Gray: \"Yet ah why should they know their fate/When sorrow never comes too late/And happiness too swiftly flies/Thought would destroy their Paradise/No more, where ignorance is bliss, tis folly to be wise.\" The path then passes a monumental granite book carved with a quote from Milton's Paradise Lost.  \"And wilt thou not be loath to leave this Paradise, but shalt possess a Paradise within thee, happier far.\"",

The virtues flash sequentially clockwise around the building at one rate; and the vices circulate counterclockwise at a slightly faster rate. At brief intervals, both the seven virtues and the seven vices flash together. The progression of the two repeating cycles playing off each other allows all possible combinations of the words to be displayed. This complicated performance, generated by the mechanical sequencing of a simple moral dichotomy, dramatizes the instability of any ethical judgment.

      "article3" : "HISTORY: In 1958, Roger Revelle's efforts to establish an Institute of Science and Engineering adjacent to the Scripps Institution of Oceanography were spearheaded by his desire to immediately construct a science and library building on the present Revelle College site. When the university was eventually constructed, university librarian Melvin Voigt devised a plan to purchase books for the three new UC campuses: UC San Diego, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Irvine. The first Science and Engineering Library in Urey Hall satisfied the science-focused school's needs. However, as faculty recruits began to found social science and humanities departments, it became clear to Chancellor John Semple Galbraith that the time had come to establish the campus's main library collections. One of the conditions of Galbraith's acceptance of the UCSD chancellorship had been that UCSD would house one of the three great libraries of the UC system. To accomplish this end, he formed a committee which commissioned architect William L. Pereira to prepare a master plan for the University Center and its focal point, the Central Library. Pereira's plan called for the University Center to be moved north and east, along with the proposed library building. This resulted in a revision of the campus long-range development plan: the three \"clusters\" of four colleges each would be more compact, allowing for an auxiliary library in each cluster. The proposed building was designed around a spheroidal tower, to maximize the stacks area that could be accessed in a given time from the center. This tower was to be situated atop a main level containing the staff and public areas of the library. The chosen site allowed for future expansions to step downwards into the canyon. Construction of the first of three increments began in July 1968; the two main floors were constructed first to form the base of the structure. This allowed for the placement of scaffolding to support construction of the tower. The Central University Library building's topping-out ceremony took place in December 1969 and its formal dedication was in March 1971.",
      "article4" : "Central Library, combined with the original Scripps Library, the Humanities-Library building (now Galbraith Hall) in Revelle College, and the Biomedical Library (built in 1969), was able to support and represent the growing university for years. In 1990, construction began on a two-story, 136,850 square foot subterranean expansion of the main level. The project included renovation of the existing facility to comply with safety standards and cost $38 million, provided by California's 1988 Proposition 78. The expansion, designed by Gunnar Birkerts, was completed in February 1993. In 1995, La Jolla resident Audrey Geisel donated $20 million to the UCSD Library, supplementing her 1991 donation of $2.3 million worth of her husband Theodor Seuss Geisel's original works. In exchange, the library was renamed Geisel Library. Between the first and second renovations of Geisel Library, several other UCSD library facilities were also renovated or closed. The biomedical library received a $17 million, 43,454 square foot expansion in 2006. In 2011, the SIO library, the IR/PS library, the Hillcrest Medical Center library, and the Center for Library Instruction and Computing Services (CLICS) were closed and their collections consolidated into Geisel Library due systemwide budget cuts. In 2015, university officials announced that Geisel Library would begin to undergo its second renovation. This renovation includes construction of a café named Audrey's on the main level of the library.",

William Pereira & Associates prepared a detailed report in 1969. Pereira originally conceived a steel-framed building, but this was changed to reinforced concrete to save on construction and maintenance costs. This change of material presented an opportunity for a more sculptural design. It was envisioned that future additions to the original building would form terraced levels around the tower base descending into the canyon. In keeping with the original master plan, these are \"deliberately designed to be subordinated to the strong, geometrical form of the existing library.\" Within its two subterranean levels are the other library sections as well as study spaces and computer labs. The tower is a prime example of brutalist architecture. It rises 8 stories to a height of 110 ft (33.5 m).

The only way to make the mural last, he said, was to use small ceramic tiles. And the only place to get the colors and the durability he needed, he insisted, was China. “It’s going to outlast the building,” Torero said. “But the way it’s installed it can be taken down and put on the next one.

      "article1" : "When UC San Diego undergraduate students Josh Hill, Victoria Santos and Alexander Han first became involved with the Solar Chill project, they never thought that they would one day have the opportunity to talk about the unique solar-powered charging station at Clinton Global Initiative University. But they will be doing just that when the annual conference takes place at UC Berkeley, April 1-3.",
      "article2" : "“I was ecstatic when I learned we were chosen to present,” said Santos, an environmental engineering major who will graduate this June. “Solar Chill has been a labor of love for our entire team—there are currently 20 of us—and Alex, Josh and I are excited to share our experience on the team’s behalf.” Launched by President Bill Clinton in 2007, Clinton Global Initiative University (CGI U) brings students, university representatives, topic experts and celebrities together to discuss and develop innovative solutions to pressing global challenges. Students create their own Commitments to Action that address specific challenges across CGI U’s five focus areas: Education, environment and climate change, poverty alleviation, peace and human rights, and public health.",
      "article3" : "Essentially a solar-powered charging station with a sustainable seating area, the Solar Chill project addresses CGIU’s environment and climate change focus. “Our goal with Solar Chill has always been to educate and inspire,” said Han, a third year student who is studying electrical engineering. “We hope to promote the use of solar energy as well as raise awareness of the possibilities for sustainable design.” The brain child of two members of the UC San Diego chapter of Engineers for a Sustainable World (ESW), Solar Chill began in 2013 with an idea. Engineering students Cyrus Jahanian and Ellen Potts were inspired by the many hammocks they had seen while visiting Costa Rica, and wondered if they could set up something similar on campus.",
      "article4" : "“Somewhere along the way, Cyrus, Ellen and the other original team members came up with the idea of incorporating a solar component with the hammocks,” said Santos. “They envisioned a unique space for students to de-stress, a place where they could recharge their minds, bodies and portable electronic devices.” While the original team members have since graduated, an evolving team of ESW members has determinedly shepherded the project along, overcoming numerous obstacles to make their dream a reality. “There were so many hurdles,” recalled Hill, the current project lead and a third year environmental engineering student. “Locations changed, aspects of the project changed, getting the approvals to build was very complicated, and we didn’t understand the various codes and standards required by the fire marshal, engineers, contractors and administration.”",
      "article5" : "He continued: “But we learned to overcome all these challenges because we were passionate about our goal and committed to working together as a team.” Now, that commitment is paying off. Solar Chill is the first student engineering project approved to be built on the UC San Diego campus, and construction is expected to be completed in the next month. Located in the north campus next to the Village at Torrey Pines and across from The Rady School, the site will feature two benches made from gabions—wire cages filled with rocks—and Trex®, an eco-friendly composite of recycled wood and plastic film. A 1.5-kilowatt solar tree will be connected to the benches, which will have electrical ports to charge laptops, tablets and mobile devices. “We’re almost there,” said Santos. “Solar Chill will soon be operational, and we can’t wait to see people using it on campus.” While the project has been student-driven, the team is quick to acknowledge the efforts of others who have helped move the project forward.",
      "sentence" : "The Solar Chill project was started by members of Engineers for a Sustainable World in 2013. The project aims to build a 1.5kW off-grid photovoltaic structure and unique social space in the North UCSD campus. The project mission is to provide by-passers with education and inspiration regarding sustainable energy alternatives while also promoting campus unity and providing a safe haven for students to de-stress.",

To others, more biologically minded, perhaps like a small blue creature living in symbiosis with its much larger host. Either way, it can be seen from multiple vantage points on campus and off. Inside, people report awe – and vertigo. There are some amazing views of the campus, the Torrey Pines mesa all around. But then there’s the fact that, except for the chandelier hanging straight from the ceiling (thanks to gravity), there isn’t a single plumb line to the house.

First proposed in 2001, assembly of the sculpture took place onsite in May 2005 and the landscaping was completed in November 2005.

      "article2" : "Ché Café was founded in 1980 by several UCSD students, including Scott Kessler, Ruth Rominger, Kim Higgs, and Joy Every. The name \"Ché\" in \"Ché Café\" is not only a nod to the late Argentine revolutionary Che Guevara, but it is also a backronym for \"Cheap Healthy Eats\".

Today, the Ché operates primarily as a venue for a variety of musical genres, many based around the DIY ethic, and is an on-and-off again vegan cafe and catering operation. It also acts as a resource for the music and art departments on campus through hosting art shows, performances and film screenings. Some of the most notable touring bands or musicians who have played the Ché include, City of Caterpillar, Rage Against the Machine, Hot Cross, Green Day, Rise Against, Billy Corgan, Blonde Redhead, At the Drive-In, The Get Up Kids, Jimmy Eat World, Deerhoof, Lightning Bolt, Black Dice, The Dillinger Escape Plan, Botch, Bright Eyes, Chumbawamba, Mike Watt, Hella, Sleep, Acid Mothers Temple, Animal Collective, Dan Deacon, Bon Iver, the Damo Suzuki Network, Unwound, and Jawbreaker. The Ché has also played host to many, if not most, of San Diego's most influential and notable indie bands, including Crossed Out, Drive Like Jehu, Crash Worship, Heroin, Antioch Arrow, Bay of Pigs, Gogogo Airheart, The Locust, Kill Me Tomorrow, Three Mile Pilot, Heavy Vegetable, Swing Kids, The Album Leaf, Weatherbox, The Plot to Blow Up the Eiffel Tower, and Cattle Decapitation.",
      "article4" : "UCSD administration clashes: Despite the university's initial support for the co-ops at UCSD, the relationship between the university and student co-ops has been in decline, with recent improvements made through mediation since 2003. The Ché Café in particular has for a long time had a very strained relationship with the university, and as with the other co-ops, there have been numerous attempts made by the university to close the space. In the spring of 2000, UCSD attempted to close the space by changing the locks without members' consent, resulting in a lock-in by members and supporters. The UCSD administration cited as motivation a fight which occurred between two patrons at a show in which one was injured (though there has been much discrepancy as to what actually took place). Following the lock-in, the university tried to force the Ché to hire security guards for every show, but it was later ruled that the university did not have such authority under the 1993 Memorandum of Understanding between the co-ops and the university.",
      "article5" : "In 2002, the Ché agreed to sponsor the BURN! collective's web project , which was previously sponsored by the co-op bookstore Groundwork Books. BURN! was a directory of radical websites, mailing lists, and resources. The BURN! directory included a link to the webpages of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), a US State Department designated foreign terrorist organization . In 2004, the UCSD administration received a complaint about the link, accused the Ché Café core members of providing \"material support\" to the FARC in violation of the USA Patriot Act, and threatened disciplinary action. In arbitration, it was determined that the BURN! project was not hosting the FARC's website, simply linking to it, and so the University subsequently dropped its threats against the Ché members. On October 21st, 2014, the San Diego County Superior Court ruled in favor of UCSD's filing of eviction towards the cafe. Ché Café was issued a notice it had to leave the premises within five days. The reasoning for the eviction claimed by the university related to unsubstantiated safety issues. Following this decision UCSD served the venue with an eviction notice on March 17th, 2015. The Ché Café was under 24/7 student-led occupation after this date, defying the court order. In July 2015, supporters of the Ché Café met with UCSD Chancellor Pradeep Khosla, and following this, the university announced a 45-day stay of eviction and agreed to fund a professional inspection of the building to assess any necessary repairs and maintenance.

For several years, he has dressed his patient and compliant weimaraners in various costumes or placed them in bizarre situations in order to be photographed. Like other conceptual artists who came to wide attention during the 1970s, Wegman used photography to record private actions or performances, often including the dogs. Unlike many of his peers, Wegman suffused these self-explorations with light-hearted humor and potent irony. Puns, double meanings, and word associations run through Wegman's early drawings, which often resemble doodles more than finished works of art.",
      "article2" : "Wegman's \"lessons\" and fairy tales illustrated with photographs of the dogs dressed in character have been seen regularly on public television's Sesame Street. To great popular acclaim, he has produced many of them in video and as books.

Painting is also one of his important ongoing activities.",
      "article3" : "For the Stuart Collection Wegman created his first major outdoor permanent sculpture: he installed a scenic - or nonscenic - overlook at one edge of the campus, near the location of the university's theater and dance complex. The site commands a view not of the Pacific Ocean, visible from the other side of the university, or some other pristine wilderness view, but of La Jolla's suburban sprawl. The centerpiece of La Jolla Vista View is a long bronze map; it transposes from Wegman's idiosyncratic drawing the supposed \"points of interest\" discernible from the overlook. These include housing developments, construction sites, and the footbridge connecting UCSD with the shopping center adjacent to the campus. Wegman's overlook, complete with a telescope, drinking fountain, and picnic table set under a palm tree, makes a simple cartoonlike connection between Southern California's still-picturesque natural scenery and its booming economic growth/development which places an ever-increasing strain on the region's environment.",
      "article4" : "Wegman's La Jolla Vista View uses the language of fantasy and humor to convey a serious message. Many of the sites Wegman has marked on his bronze map are temporary - building construction, birds in flight, or a group of people walking their dogs. These immediately \"outdated\" points of interest cause viewers to contemplate the rapidity of change in everyday life, and the constant revision of history which results. New buildings constructed since the drawing was done in 1987 become markers of time as well as place. By defamiliarizing the ordinary world of suburban life - through its transformation into an exotic or scenic overlook - Wegman encourages the university community to view its surroundings with fresh and newly critical eyes.",

In each series of canvases during the 1960s Irwin questioned the fundamental characteristics of his medium: the nature of the painted mark, the quality of light, and the limitations of the canvas itself as a bounded, rectilinear support. This process of inquiry led him to give up painting altogether by 1970. Irwin decided to respond to situations, rather than produce autonomous works of art in the isolation of his studio. This attitude led to several architectural installations in museums and other sites which provoked viewers into an awareness of their own processes of perception, as well as their expectations of art.",
      "article3" : "For his contribution to the Stuart Collection, Two Running Violet V Forms (his first permanent installation in California) Irwin was drawn to the eucalyptus groves east of the Mandeville Center and adjacent to the Faculty Club. The contradiction inherent in this manmade forest appealed to him; the geometric regularity of the grid of trees is balanced by the infinite variety of light and detail which the natural setting nevertheless provides. Irwin installed two fencelike structures in V-forms amidst the trees. The \"fences\" are blue-violet, plastic-coated, small gauge chain-link fencing supported by stainless steel poles which average twenty-five feet in height. The structure maintains a constant elevation as the hillside terrain drops gently beneath it. Purple flowering iceplant, echoing but not matching the color of the chain link, is planted under the fence.",
      "article4" : "At no point is the fence an obstacle; rather it acts as a screen reflecting the changes in light throughout the day and the year, the moment and the season. Its gentle introduction of industrialized geometry recalls the unnatural grid which organized the grove, and suggests a fantastic or uncanny intrusion into the forest. For people who walk the grove's various paths, Irwin's sculpture provides an ever-changing perceptual experience - sometimes dramatic, and sometimes so modest it seems to disappear.",
      "article5" : "Irwin was the recipient of a prestigious MacArthur Foundation award in 1984. In 1992, he was commissioned to create the Central Gardens at The J. Paul Getty Center in Los Angeles.  In 2000 Irwin redefined an old Nabisco factory into the Dia:Beacon Art Center in Beacon, NY.  He lives in San Diego.",

Some are even told as truth at freshman orientations or to gullible librarians willing to put them in print: The winter before the sculpture was constructed was very stormy and windy. When the students came back after spring break to see the sculpture, they thought it was put up to keep the trees from falling down. Another rumor had it that some giraffes escaped from the San Diego zoo. It seems (according to the same rumor) that giraffes really like eucalyptus leaves. The fences were put up to help capture the giraffes so they could be returned to the zoo. Even today, if you ask someone what the fences are, you might get \"giraffe catcher\" as an answer. Or they might tell you it's a volleyball net for giants",

Allen is well known for his installation and performance projects. One such piece, Youth in Asia, reflected on the experience of the Vietnam War by exploring American value systems through a variety of means ranging from mass cultural heroes to fairy tale protagonists like Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, to the ethos of roadhouses in the American Southwest. More recently, Allen presented his extensive multimedia project,Dugout, based on the stories he heard while growing up in West Texas.",

For the literary tree, Bale Allen delivers his poem about scabs, the poet Philip Levine recites, plus there are Navajo chants, translations of Aztec poems, duck calls, and many other sound works.

It is not surprising that students have dubbed this area the \"Enchanted Forest.\" At the entrance to the vast, geometric library the third tree of Allen's installation remains silent - perhaps another form of the tree of knowledge, perhaps a reminder that trees must be cut down to print books and build buildings, perhaps a dance form, or perhaps noting that one can acquire knowledge both through observation of nature and through research. Since completing Trees, Allen has done many public works across the country, including CORPORATE HEAD and the Citicorp Building in Los Angeles and large bronze leaf (BELIEF) for The Vontz Cancer research center designed by Frank Gehry in Cincinnati. He has also released eleven CDs (Sugar Hill Records) and written and produced seven theater pieces including Chippy for the American Music Theater Festival in Philadelphia and the Lincoln Center in New York City. In 1997, he was inducted into the Buddy Holly \"Walk of Fame\" in Lubbock, Texas. He is currently working on GHOST SHIP RODEZ, a music theater piece and exhibition of multimedia works based loosely on the life of French theater visionary and artist, Antonin Artaud.
