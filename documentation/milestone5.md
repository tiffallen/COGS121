<h2> Tiffany: Map Boundaries </h2>
<p> 
Researched different map APIS, chose OpenLayers
Made the map not start zoomed out to the entire world, making it easier for the user to see the points of interest around them.
Restrict the boundaries of the map that is shown in our app, we will be focusing on the UCSD campus and this will be reflected in the app as well.
