<h1> Milestone 10: Elevator Pitches </h1>

<h2> What are you trying to do? </h2>
<p> We are trying to make it easier for potential, prospective, and current UCSD students and tourists to get to know our beautiful campus, gain knowledge of the history of UCSD, and find information about on-campus facilities. This application will  encourage the users to explore the campus around them and learn more about the history of each landmark on campus. </p>

<h2> How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
</h2>
<p> Today this is mostly done by word of mouth / campus tours about different locations on campus, and can be a bit hard to find without a guide. For the Stuart collection specifically, information can be found through a video documentary on youtube, which can be time consuming, or through various wikipedia / google search pages, which can take a while to gather information. Additionally, people can try to find their way around campus through the use of Google maps (or something similar), but the locations specific to UCSD are not featured in this general map, and are hard to explore without knowing specifically what you are searching for.</p>

<h2> What’s new in your approach and why do you think it’ll be successful?
</h2>
<p> We’re introducing a web application that allows users to see special sites, attractions, and campus facilities on an interactive map. Instead of needing to Google (many locations around campus are not found on Google maps)/ask around for information, users can simply take a look at the map, and click on icons to read/find out more about them. Users will be able to apply filters to the map, depending on whether they are looking to explore the various art exhibitions, find a good place to study, or see which gyms/dining halls are currently open. We think this application will be successful, because it combines functionality from multiple sources (Google maps, search engines, Wikipedia, UCSD website, etc...) into one application, significantly improving the user experience.</p>

<h2> Who cares? If you are successful, what difference will it make?
</h2>
<p> 
Incoming and prospective students will be able to explore UCSD much more easily without having to depend on a paper map or on a tour guide. Students will be able to become more knowledgeable about the various landmarks and places that UCSD has, and feel more of a connection to the campus. They will also have an easier way to find out which campus facilities are open/closed. This could help increase students SIRing to UCSD, and would help current UCSD students to feel more of a community on campus by encouraging them to explore the school. </p>
