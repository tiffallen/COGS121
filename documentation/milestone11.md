<h1> Milestone 9 â€“ Project Progress </h1>

<h2> Jason: Full-text search, improved filter, dynamic map-resizing, bug fixes </h2>
<p> 
  - Added new feature: Full-text search. Using Bonsai and Flashlight to host an Elasticsearch instance on Heroku that listens to our Firebase database. When a user filters/searches, an Elasticsearch query is written to our Firebase database, which gets pulled by Bonsai, which processes the query and writes it back to the Firebase database. <br />
  - Made filters and searches stack with each other. <br />
  - Added new feature: For filters and searches that produce at least one result, the map now centers upon the first result.<br />
  - Added new feature: Dynamic map resizing when window dimensions change. <br />
  - Switch from using JSON to Firebase and Elasticsearch as primary storage. <br />
  - Radio buttons switched to dropdown to save space. "Clear form" X appears on search input box. <br />
  - Improved layout for mobile view. <br />
  - Fixed issue causing map to recenter whenever location data was updated. <br />
  - Fixed mixed protocol bug preventing resources from loading properly.
