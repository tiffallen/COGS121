<h2> Tiffany:   </h2>
<p> 
- finished the introduction page for new users, making the style match the login page <br />
- the introduction page is in FAQ format. The questions are toggable so that the user can only open the questions that they are curious about </ br>
    - made the profile page showcase information from the user's login information such as their username <br />
    - made default user information until the user updates their own <br />'
    - if a user hasn't added a field of the information (such as year or college), the blank space is not shown on their profile </ br>
    - any saves from the user are added to the firebase database under the user's information and then
    showcased on their profile page, I had a lot of trouble saving the firebase username data/accessing it at other points in our web application<br />
