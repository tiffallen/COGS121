<h2> Stephanie: Creating Popups. location optimization. List of future locations </h2>
<p> 
	Created actual popups, comapred to last week where we had a text on top of the map saying the location name. Included coordinates with the popups, as well as adding code to exlude areas that didnt have a location marker from having a popup. Also optomized the code so adding locations is easier, by having locations organized in an array, and added through a for loop. Created list of possible locations we can feature in './documentation/locaationsToFeature.md'

<h2> Tiffany: What you contributed </h2>
<p> 
	Started working on how to incorporate JSON objects into the project. We don't have a local server set up yet so I was running into problems about how to access a local JSON object without an ajax call. We have a temporary fix right now of using data arrays within the javascript file to keep track of the locations. Going to continue working on the JSON and server (firebase or heroku) so that we can move from using data arrays to utilizing JSON to store all of the information/data about each location by the next milestone.
