<h1> Paper Prototypes for UCSD Explorer </h1>

<h2> Jimmy: Main Map Page </h2>
<p> This page is the main exploration page of our app. Here you can search specific key words, see what there is to explore and see in your area, and let's you click on the pins to get more information on them. There will also be triton man with a tutorial </p>

<h2> Jason: Specific Exhibit page v.1 </h2>
<p> My prototype shows the page for an exhibit/site of interest. It allows the user to 1) show the exhibit's location on the map, 2) add to the user's favorites, 3) read an article about it, 4) read some fun facts, and 5) check out a photo gallery.

<h2> Stephanie: Specific Exhibit page v.2 </h2>
<p> This page lets you see the specific information of the location you have found. Once in this page you can see the name, an image of, a rating, quick info, link to an article and similar locations. This gives the user any information they might want, as well as other areas to explore </p>

<h2> Tiffany: All pieces list </h2>
<p> I did a prototype of when the user wishes to see a list of all of the potential places to visit in one page. At the top of the screen is a search bar so that the user can search through all of the pins to find the specific place they are looking for (if they know). Next is picture thumbnails (plus a title) where the user can click on the image to expand to that pin's specific description page. On the bottom is a variety of links to navigate through the app to the main map page, the all places tab, and then the user's profile page. </p>
