<h1> Paper Prototypes 2.0 for UCSD Explorer </h1>

<h2> Jimmy</h2>
<p> My Account Page:
For this page I included the user’s basic info, this info would be optional and only displayed if the user provides it. Info includes their name, where they are from, their class year, and facebook name. I decided to but this just in case anyone wants to potentially contact a user to ask questions about a place. I also included their favorite places in a listview that is scrollable from left to right, this includes the name of the place, a picture of it and a brief description.  I also included past reviews that the user has done with the name of the place, the rating given and the review as well. The last thing I included was all the pictures that the user has shared in the app. These would be able to be seen in full screen if clicked. I also included an account settings button on the right top corner in case the user wants to modify info like name and password. 

Info Page:
I included the name and description on the top, the user can have the option to read the full description by clicking on the “keep reading” button, this will then push everything down and display the rest of the text. I also included the photos taken of the specific place and also reviews given by users where it shows the rating given and the review. The pictures and photos list is scrollable from left to right. 

List View Page:
For the list view page, I decided to have a box-like design that will have the name of the place, a small picture of the place, and then a brief description that can be clicked on to move to the info page of the place. The list has a button where you can choose if you want to sort the list by distance from you or by average use rating. This list is scrollable aswell from up to down. Clicking back would take you back to the map view of the app.</p>

<h2> Jason </h2>
<p> Screen 1 shows the user profile. The main functionality of this page is to list/link the user’s lists of locations (i.e. favorites list, visited list, etc...). The user can also upload/change his or her profile picture. Clicking on a list opens the list.
Screen 2 shows a list of locations (in this case, the visited list). The user can choose which list to display, filter the locations based on labels (i.e. art), and sort them based on some attribute (i.e. proximity). Clicking on a location opens the screen for that location.
Screen 3 shows a location page. The location page contains an article describing the location, a photo gallery, as well as some other details. The user can add the location to their favorites list, save it for later, add a rating, show it on the map, and edit its info.

<h2> Stephanie </h2>
<p> This prototype has the map which we already use and created other pages around it. List shows a list view of all nearby locations and lets you sort by parameters and filter out locations, depending on what you want to see. Newsfeed lets you see where your friends are going, or where people in this area are going. Your profile shows you your accomplishments such as how much of the campuses you have explored and what badges you have earned (going to all art locations, all food locations etc), and lets you visually see what you have explored and what you are missing. Your friends can also see your photos. Finally the detailed location page shows you information and pictures of the location, similar locations and lets you check in (if you are nearby) and rate the location </p>

<h2> Tiffany </h2>
<p> I have three of the pages included in my prototype. The first prototype is in the top left and it is the all locations page. Basically, it lists all of the available locations to view. You can search for specific locations in the search bar and also filter the list by pre-determined tags. The main body of the prototype is taken up by the list of all the locations (featuring a picture of the location and the name). Each page has a footer featuring the home page (the main map), a link to the all location page, and then a link to the my profile page. The second prototype (on the right side) is the page where the user clicks on a specific location. It is a general location page. It features the Location's name at the top. The user then has the option to mark it as a "to-go" location (to visit later), a "check-in" location (the user has already visited it), and a "rating" where the user can rate the location from 1-5 stars. Directly to the right the user can see the location's overall rating.
The main section of the page is consumed by a picture of the location and then a short description describing the location. The bottom of the page has a short list of nearby locations (in picture tabs). The last prototype (bottom left) is the user's profile page. I wanted to keep this page simple. It just features the user's checked-in places in a list and their "to go to places." </p>
