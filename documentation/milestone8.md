<p> I have three of the pages included in my prototype. The first prototype is in the top left and it is the all locations page. Basically, it lists all of the available locations to view. You can search for specific locations in the search bar and also filter the list by pre-determined tags. The main body of the prototype is taken up by the list of all the locations (featuring a picture of the location and the name). Each page has a footer featuring the home page (the main map), a link to the all location page, and then a link to the my profile page. The second prototype (on the right side) is the page where the user clicks on a specific location. It is a general location page. It features the Location's name at the top. The user then has the option to mark it as a "to-go" location (to visit later), a "check-in" location (the user has already visited it), and a "rating" where the user can rate the location from 1-5 stars. Directly to the right the user can see the location's overall rating.
The main section of the page is consumed by a picture of the location and then a short description describing the location. The bottom of the page has a short list of nearby locations (in picture tabs). The last prototype (bottom left) is the user's profile page. I wanted to keep this page simple. It just features the user's checked-in places in a list and their "to go to places." </p>
