<h1> Paper Prototypes for UCSD Explorer </h1>

<h2> Jimmy: Main Login Page </h2>

<h2> Jason: Specific Exhibit page v.1 </h2>

<h2> Stephanie: Specific Exhibit page v.2 </h2>

<h2> Tiffany: All pieces list </h2>
<p> I did a prototype of when the user wishes to see a list of all of the potential places to visit in one page. At the top of the screen is a search bar so that the user can search through all of the pins to find the specific place they are looking for (if they know). Next is picture thumbnails (plus a title) where the user can click on the image to expand to that pin's specific description page. On the bottom is a variety of links to navigate through the app to the main map page, the all places tab, and then the user's profile page. </p>
